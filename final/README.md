# Putting it all together
## More than 4 arguments
We allow more than 4 arguments in function calls by putting the 5th and later arguments into the stack following the MIPS calling convention. `more_args.tig` is a simple test case for this functionality as its `printMoreArgs` function takes 7 arguments.
